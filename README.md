# Advent of Code 2023 - Go Edition

This repository is my playground for solving the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges using the Go programming language. 
Unlike [my Advent of Code 2022 project](https://github.com/philippdrebes/AdventOfCode2022), where I focused on learning Rust, this year is all about problem-solving and refining my Go skills.

## Goals

1. **Improve Go Skills**: Although I'm already familiar with Go, I aim to further deepen my understanding and capabilities with the language.
2. **Problem-Solving**: This year, the focus is strongly on sharpening problem-solving skills.

## Project Structure

The project structure will be updated once finalized.

## Usage

To run the code for a specific day:

1. Navigate to the corresponding `dayXX` directory.
2. Run `go build` to compile the Go source file into an executable.
3. Run the resulting executable to solve the challenge.

## Note

- This repository is focused on honing problem-solving abilities and perfecting Go language skills.
- Your suggestions for code improvement are welcome.
